1. Redo structure with the topic in mind (Latent Representation of Topographic Classes in Remote Sensing Image Data using Autoencoders"

2. Gather questions on Tensorflow for Mathias

3. Describe the Data we have available how it was gathered what the channels mean and how they are good for our use case

4. Describe what Autoencoders we have how they work and what they are capable of

5. Describe the latent code and how it is interesting how it is useful and why it is complicated to understand and gain insight of it. (high dimensional)

6. Describe what experiments can be done with the given data to gain an understanding of the latent code. (comparing normal AE with VAE to explain the value of using a VAE?)

7. Tools to evaluate the latent code further
