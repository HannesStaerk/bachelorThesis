Data

The available Data are images of the two United States cities Jacksonville in Florida and Omaha in Nebraska taken from the US3D Dataset (Semantic Stereo for Incidental Satellite Images Bosch). Multiple images of the same locations are given and they consist of the three different types RGB, nDSM, MSI and Classification pictures. The RGB files have 1024 x 1024 pixels, each of which is described by three integer values ranging from 0 to 255 representing the intensity of either red, green or blue. This corresponds to a normal image and can be visualized as such. For the locations photographed in the three channel RBG pictures there is an additional 1024 x 1024 DSM image with a single channel that describes the height of each pixel with a number ranging from ??? to ???.
