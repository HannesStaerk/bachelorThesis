Data

The available Data are images of the two United States cities Jacksonville in Florida and Omaha in Nebraska taken from the US3D Dataset (*"Semantic Stereo for Incidental Satellite Images Bosch*"). Multiple images and semantic labeling of the same locations is given with three different types of imagery RGB, DSM, VNIR. Those images were taken by  The RGB files have 1024 x 1024 pixels, each of which is described by three integer values ranging from 0 to 255 representing the intensity of either red, green or blue. This corresponds to a normal image and can be visualized as such. For the locations photographed in the three channel RBG pictures there is an additional 1024 x 1024 DSM image with a single channel that describes the height of each pixel with a higher number representing a greater height. The next class of images are the very near infrared images or in short VNIR images which cointain eight channels for eight different bands of the spectrum with a ground sample distance of 1.3 meters.  Lastly there are semantic labeled pictures with one channel that has a number encoding one of five different classes. Those classes are vegetation, water, ground, building and clutter.\
