\subsection{Conclusion}

The latent space of variational autoencoders for aerial images is investigated and visualized 
which allows for an increased understanding of the performed unsupervised clustering and the 
latent representation in general. For that purpose the thesis first offers a brief introduction
into neural networks and convolutional architecture as well as a comprehensive explanation 
of how VAEs improve standard autoencoders to generate a useful continuous latent space.
