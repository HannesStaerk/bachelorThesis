**Introduction**\
Stero correspondence means to match pictures of the same place at different times together?
Or is this just about getting a DSM and semantic labels? See Pairwise semantic Stereo for explaination
The Data has semantic labels and the corresponding pictures are grouped together.\
What does *"Deep learning methods incorporating semantic priors"* mean? That finding corresponding
images works particularly well if the CNN is trained to find the semantic labels?

*"This dataset provides training and validation data to enable research for pairwise semantic stereo and multi-view semantic 3D reconstruction"*

*"single image height estimation from remote sensing images"*

**The US3D Dataset**\
*"The US3D dataset currently includes approximately 100 square kilometer coverage for the United States cities of Jacksonville, Florida and Omaha, Nebraska"*\
In Track1 there is data of Jacksonvill (JAX) and Omaha (OMA)


**Semantic Labels**\
Figure 4 and 5 explain the Data very well\

*"Building polygons from the HSIP dataset were employed as ground truth labels for building classification"*

#### OUR DATA
**Labeled Satellite Image Tiles**\
*"Satellite images are provided in geographically non-overlapping tiles, with orthorectified semantic labels, XYZ coordinates, and normalized DSM above-ground heights all projected into each image plane. Each image tile is
aligned with lidar intensity using the mutual information metric and the RPC line and sample offset metadata are updated. Solar angle metadata is exploited to cast shadows in the lidar intensity image to improve reliability of image matching. Pan-sharpened images are produced for both three-channel RGB and eight-channel VNIR. All sensor metadata is retained in each tiled image.*"

**Pairwise Semantic Stereo**\
*"Given pairs of epipolar rectified images, the objective is to produce accurate semantic labels and stereo disparity estimates."*\

What are the differeces between DSM, DTM, and nDSM and what do we have in our Ground Truth folder?
